This Github repository is intended to complement the publication:

Loman NJ, et al.  Performance comparison of bench-top sequencing
instruments. Nature Biotechnology. 2012 (In Press)

At the moment it contains the scripts used to produce tables and
figures in the paper, as well as the variety of assemblies
produced.

Guide to directories:

 analysis/    - Scripts to generate figures and tables.

 annotations/ - E. coli strain 280 reference annotation (Gbk
                format)

 assemblies/  - Draft assemblies from benchtop data

 scripts/     - Repository of scripts used for analysis.

My intention is to update this repository and make it easy to
reproduce the full range of analysis done for this article, and
for others to use the scripts for their own analysis. Please
use the Github "watch" facility if you wish to track these updates.

Currently due to Github space limitations, the sequence files
are available via the SRA. I plan to write a Makefile which can
extract them automatically into the workspace.
